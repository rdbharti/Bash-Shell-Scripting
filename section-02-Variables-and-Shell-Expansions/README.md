# Variables and Shell Expansions
----

- Variables allow us to store useful data under convinient names.
- Shell expansions are very powerful feature that allows us to retrieve data, process command output, \
and perform calculations.


# What you will learn.
1. Craete **user-defined variables** to save useful information in your scripts.
2. Use some common **environment variables** that bash makes available.
3. Use **parameter expansion** to get data back out of your variables.
4. Use some **parameter expansion** tricks to modify that data in a variety of useful ways.
5. Use **command substitution** to work with the output of commands and save the output inside variables for later use.
6. Use **arithmetic expansion** and the **bc** command to do simple mathematical calculations
7 Use **tilde-expansion** and the **brace expansion** to makke working on the command line more convenient.
