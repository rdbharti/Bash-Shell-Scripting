# Project: Read Command

## Read Command Project Brief


You are setting up a new switchboard for your company's phone system. You need to collect everyoneâ€™s current extension numbers and the pin code that they want to use when making calls.

Because there is no internal phone, you decide to write a bash script to request this information from each of your colleagues, and write it to a csv file to process later.
Your Task

Step 1: Firstly you can create a script called get_extensions.

In this script you will need to ask your user for 4 pieces of information using the read command.

    What is your first name?:

    What is your surname/family name?:

    What is your extension number?:

    What access code would you like to use when dialing in?:

You must advise the user that their extension number and access code must both be exactly 4 digits long.

**Note:** You should ensure that the extension and pin numbers are exactly 4 digits long. Check out the -N option in the read command documentation, which you can access by running the command help read

**Hint:** When entering private information like access codes, it is always better to prevent what the user types from appearing in the terminal.

**Hint:** Use the echo command to add blank lines where necessary to nicely format the user interface.


**Step 2:**

Using the echo command you then need to save this information to a file called extensions.csv in the following format:

firstname,lastname,extension,access

Saving the data like this will make it possible to open the data in Microsoft Excel or some other spreadsheet software for processing (try it out!)

**Hint:** Make sure that the script appends data to the extensions.csv file each time the script is run.
