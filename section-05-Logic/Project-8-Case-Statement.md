# Project: Case Statements
### Case Statements Project Brief

**Scenario**

You work as an engineer at a travel agency, and you need to develop a script that will provide users with a list of possible cities and, based on the city that they select, advise them which country that city is in.
Your Task

**Step 1:** Firstly you need to create a select statement in your script that will present to the user a list of the below cities to choose from.

Tokyo, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Dubai, Manchester, New York, Paris Bangalore, Johannesburg, Istanbul, Milan, Abu Dhabi, Pune, Nairobi, Berlin, Karachi

**Step 2:** Secondly you need to set up a case statement that will match each of these cities as cases to their respective countries and echo out the country name to the user of the script.
**
Note:** You need to place your case statement inside of the select statement.

**Note:** Some of the cities are in the same country. You can use a | to separate these within the same case rather than creating separate cases for each.

**For example:**
